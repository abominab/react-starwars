Put any notes for us here.

For the planet dropdown when editing a card I was trying to get the useContext hook to work. I've played w/ that a little and been able to get it work before but for some reason it wasn't quite lining up this time so I moved on as to not lose as much time.

I'm not certain if that pattern I have in app.js of useEffect based on my reducers state is a best practice or not but it was working well for what I needed. I would probably want to have some sort of timeout or debounce to limit API calls when searching but for this it worked fine.

I also would have cleaned up my styles a little more, especially for the card edit but I put priority on trying to get more steps done.
